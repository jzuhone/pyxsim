   Simulated X-ray events from a binary cluster merger with mass ratio of 1:3,
   initial impact parameter of 0.5 Mpc, at an epoch of 2.0 Gyr. Events were
   convolved with the <em>Chandra</em> ACIS-I responses. Image taken from the

What is pyXSIM?
---------------

pyXSIM is a Python package for simulating X-ray emission from astrophysical
sources.

X-rays probe the high-energy universe, from hot galaxy clusters to compact
objects such as neutron stars and black holes and many interesting sources in
between. pyXSIM makes it possible to generate synthetic X-ray observations of
these sources from a wide variety of models, whether from grid-based simulation
codes such as FLASH, Enzo, and Athena, to particle-based codes such as Gadget
and AREPO, and even from datasets that have been created "by hand", such as from
NumPy arrays. pyXSIM also provides facilities for manipulating the synthetic
observations it produces in various ways, as well as ways to export the
simulated X-ray events to other software packages to simulate the end products
of specific X-ray observatories.
